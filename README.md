This program simulates races between n runners and determines the fastest three without the use of a timer.
Runners can only race in groups of five and the fastests of each group are raced until one fastest is determined.
The fastest and second fastest of the runner-ups are the second and third fastest overall.

This repository contains a .py and an .ipynb file. It was originally written for use for a jupyter notebook environment
and works best when opened with one. That being said, the .py file is also completely functional and still demonstrates all
of the program's functions.
